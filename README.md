# X-Sudoku
Nothing extravagant, but here is the first small project I wrote on Python by myself.

### Let's try it out!
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
Download the file and plug it into your editor. 
At the beginning of the code, there will be a board variable, which is an array of arrays representing a sudoku board.
Input a starter boarde of your choice and run the program to see the completed puzzle!

### Improvements?
I am currently working to make a GUI for the sudoku solver using Pygames.
Stay tuned for updates!
